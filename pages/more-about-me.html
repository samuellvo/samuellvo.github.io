<p style = "color:white;"class = "blurb" > Above, you'll find any courses that are major-related!
    <br> <br>
    I am particularly enthused about logic-based puzzles and their subsequent problem-solving --
    Unsurprisingly, and resultantly, I enjoy most STEM coursework and fields! <br><br>

    In some of my freetime between my courses, I almost <i>live</i> and <i>breathe</i> tutoring!
    You'll find me most often either conducting private tutoring sessions or tutoring
    students at my college's STEM center; from multivariable calculus and it's prerequisites, 
    Newtonian mechanics, and a plethora of coding topics. I also offer services for a wide variety of AP coursework.
    <br><br>

    I am a manager of a cafe-bakery local to my area, so I quite enjoy good bread and coffee.
    Leveraging this position, I also organize schedulings with local organizations &#40e.g school districts, teachers' unions,
    family centers, homeless shelters, etc.&#41  such that any daily, leftover bakery products can be donated
    instead of wasting them. <br> <br>

    Needless to say, if I live and breathe tutoring, you'll find that I enjoy coding and computer science at least as much.
