# TEST WEBSITE
My personal website portfolio as I teach myself web development!

This was created in Spring of 2023 where I had very little experience creating projects out of my intro classes. I have since (last updated Spring 2024) worked with a variety of more libraries, applications, and more including:
- General HTML/CSS/JS
- Maven, project management in Java
- Spring Boot MVC / WebFlux, applying RESTful models to both standard and reactive paradigms
- Spring Thyme Template, processing for i18n and l10n
- MongoDB + Compass GUI, storing/retrieving/editing JSON documents
- WireShark, tracing packet headers to redirect or properly process requests and packet payloads
- Docker, standardizing dev environments by reducing delta between pre-installed library versions, etc
- ActivityPub Protocol, developing our web application to this protocol's standards s.t. we can effectively decentralize our application
- Decentralized Backend Architecture using Mastodon's distributed instances
- React, Frontend Library and Framework

And other libraries/technologies not related to web development! More on my resume.
